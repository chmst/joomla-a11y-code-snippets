##How do we use Icons and make them accessible?##

Example 1) 

Code: <span class="icon-plus"></span>

This is probably wrong. 
Only sighted users see the icon, blind users see nothing. 
If the screenreader announces nothing, this could be ok for a decorative element. 
If the screenreader announces somthing, then it is an issue.

Example 2) Quckicons on the backend dashboard

Code: <span class="icon-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>

This is correct if the icon is decorative only 
AND if the meaning is obvious and world wide well-known. 

Example 3) Legend at the bottom of permission table in com_users

Code: <span class="icon-check" aria-hidden="true"></span><?php echo Text::_('COM_YOURTEXT_HERE'); ?>

Not sure if this is correct. 
Sighted users see an icon followed by an explanation which is visible and announced. 
BUT: Blind users get an explanation for something what they cannot see. 

Example 4) 

Code: <span class="icon-check" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="visibility: hidden"><?php echo Text::_('COM_YOURTEXT_HERE'); ?></span>

Correct: An icon which is visible for sighted users and a text which is announced by screenreaders but is not visible.
